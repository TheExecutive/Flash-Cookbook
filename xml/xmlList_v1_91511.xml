					<![CDATA[function functionName():ReturnType

				<notes>
					function - declares you are creating a new function
					functionName() - acts as a unique identifier for the function. 
					() - the parenthatsis hold optional parameters, parameters are arguments you can pass with a function.
					ReturnType - if your function returns a value, this is where you define that type of value will be returned. If no value is returned use "void" for the ReturnType.

					<![CDATA[private function stringLength(pString:String):Number
					{
						return pString.length;
					}]]>
				</code>
				<notes>
					private - accessor type, defines where a function is private or public.
					function - declares you are creating a new function
					stringLength() - acts as a unique identifier for the function. Must not start with a number but can contain numbers, letters, and underscores.
					(pString:String) - the parameter that is being passed into the function. This is looking for a variable named pString that is data typed as a String.
					Number - is the ReturnType, this function will return a number
					return pString.length - this will return the number of characters that compose the variable pString. So if pString was equal to the word "Cat" the length of pString would be "3".

					<![CDATA[MovieClip.play()]]>
				</code>
				<notes>
					MovieClip - the object that will call the function
					play() - the function being called.
					Executing this code would allow a movie clip to call the play() function, which would then play the movie clip.

				</code>
				<notes>
					this - refers to the parent container, usually the stage, but can also be used to refer to assets created in the Flash IDE
					myFunction - the name of the function being called, remember this is a unique identifier and can be named anything you would like, but it can not start with a number
					(var1, var2) - the parameters being passed to the function.
